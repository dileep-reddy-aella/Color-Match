# Color-Match

* This is a color matching game, where the player is presented with six colors on the screen and on top of the page a color is given in RGB color code format.
* In RGB(red_val,green_val,blue_val) the values range between RGB(0,0,0) to RGB(255,255,255).
* Where in the first one all value of each color is zero and this produces a black color.
* In second case all colors are at maximum and this produces white color.
* So based on this random values RGB are displayed on top and we need to match it with the colors on the screen.

* If you guess it wrong the card will disappear.
* This will continue until you guess the correct color.
